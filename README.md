# AssemblyScript transformer for Parcel + an example app
## Please note!
The project is at its early stage of development, so it's not stable and even the base branch (`master`) be broken. 


## Quick start
1. Please execute `yarn` in the same directory where this README is located.
2. `cd example`
3. `yarn build:web |cat`
That should be enough to compile build the example app. 

If something does not work as expected, please [open an issue](https://github.com/dipdowel/parcel-transformer-assemblyscript-codument/issues). 
If you want to suggest an improvement, please [fork](https://github.com/dipdowel/parcel-transformer-assemblyscript-codument/) and open a PR.
